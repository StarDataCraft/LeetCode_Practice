# Maximum Average Subarray I

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the subarray of length `k` that has the maximum average and return this maximum average.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation: The subarray [12,-5,-6,50] has the maximum average of 12.75.

Solution Approach: Sliding Window

Explanation

To efficiently find the maximum average of a subarray of length k, we can use the sliding window technique.

Key Concepts

	1.	Fixed-Length Sliding Window:
	•	We maintain a window of length k and slide it across the array to find the subarray with the maximum sum.
	•	Instead of recalculating the sum from scratch for each window, we update the sum by subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the element that comes into the window.
	2.	Initial Window Setup:
	•	Start by calculating the sum of the first k elements, which forms the initial window.
	•	This gives us a starting point for comparing the sum of subsequent subarrays.
	3.	Updating the Window:
	•	As we move the window to the right, subtract the element at the start of the previous window and add the element at the end of the current window.
	•	Update the maximum sum whenever the new window’s sum is greater than the current maximum sum.

Code Implementation

class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Calculate initial window sum
        current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_sum = current_sum

        # Slide the window across the array
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            current_sum = current_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

        # Return the maximum average
        return max_sum / k

Detailed Steps

	1.	Initial Calculation:
	•	Compute the sum of the first k elements, which serves as the starting sum for the sliding window.
	2.	Sliding the Window:
	•	For each element from k to n-1 (where n is the length of nums):
	•	Subtract the element that is no longer in the window (nums[i - k]).
	•	Add the new element that enters the window (nums[i]).
	•	Update the maximum sum if the current sum is greater.
	3.	Calculating Maximum Average:
	•	The maximum average is obtained by dividing the max_sum by k.

Complexity Analysis

	•	Time Complexity: O(n)
	•	We traverse the array once, making the time complexity linear.
	•	Space Complexity: O(1)
	•	We use a constant amount of extra space, as we’re only storing variables for sums and indices.

Common Mistakes and Missed Points

	1.	Avoiding Recalculating the Sum:
	•	In the initial solution, there was repeated calculation of the sum for each window, leading to time limit exceeded (TLE).
	•	Use a sliding window to incrementally update the sum, which reduces the time complexity.
	2.	Starting with the First Window:
	•	Ensure the initial window sum is calculated before starting the sliding window loop.
	3.	Handling Edge Cases:
	•	If the array length is exactly k, return the average of the entire array.
	•	If k is larger than the array length, handle it with appropriate error checks (though the problem constraints usually prevent this).

Summary

	•	The sliding window approach efficiently finds the maximum sum of a fixed-length subarray.
	•	By maintaining the sum incrementally, we avoid unnecessary recomputation, ensuring linear time complexity.
	•	This technique is particularly useful for problems involving fixed-length subarrays or sequences.
