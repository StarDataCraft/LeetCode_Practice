# Search Insert Position: Why Return `left`

## User's Question
> Why do we return `left` in the "Search Insert Position" problem?

## Explanation

### 1. **Purpose of Returning `left`**
- In binary search, `left` always represents the position where the target should be inserted if it is not found in the array.
- When the binary search loop ends, `left` points to the smallest index where the target could either be inserted or found.

### 2. **How Binary Search Works in This Problem**
- The binary search loop runs with the condition `while left <= right`.
- In each iteration:
  - If `nums[mid]` is less than the target, we move the left boundary to `left = mid + 1`.
  - If `nums[mid]` is greater than or equal to the target, we move the right boundary to `right = mid - 1`.
- When the loop terminates, `left` is positioned at the index where the target should be inserted, as it points to the **first element greater than or equal to the target**.

### 3. Example
Consider the array `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]` with the target `target = 2`:

1. **Initial state**: `left = 0`, `right = 3`.
2. **First iteration**:
   - `mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`, `nums[mid] = 3`.
   - Since `2 < 3`, update `right = mid - 1 = 0`.
3. **Second iteration**:
   - `left = 0`, `right = 0`, `mid = (0 + 0) // 2 = 0`, `nums[mid] = 1`.
   - Since `2 > 1`, update `left = mid + 1 = 1`.

The loop ends with `left = 1`, indicating the target should be inserted at index `1`.

### 4. Summary
- **`left` represents the correct insertion position**: It indicates where the target should be if itâ€™s not already present in the array.
- The value of `left` is valid whether the target is found or not, making it the accurate insertion index.
- Returning `left` ensures both **correctness** and **consistency** in handling target values that are either present or absent in the array.

### Key Takeaway
- The use of `return left` is integral to the binary search approach in this problem because it guarantees the correct insertion position, even when the target is not found.
